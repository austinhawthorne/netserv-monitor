A simple web page to allow for monitoring and service control over DNSMASQ (DHCP) and FreeRADIUS services.  Will display the latest DHCP leases and RADIUS requests along with controls to start and stop those services.  Must be run on the same host running those services.  

Just run 'servmon.py' and connect to the site via http://<host-ip>:8080.
